# Admin

## How can we send commands ("SLEEP", "RESTART", "ARE-YOU-THERE", etc) to individual nodes in the network, rather than treat them as pass-through intermediaries?

It may be possible to have an admin node which is able to communicate directly with other nodes to send these commands to them. This only works if the admin is in the same network as these other nodes in order to be able to communicate with the other nodes and establish the hierarchy where the admin node has higher power than the other nodes. With this, the admin can send these commands to make sure each node is working and to better control the flow of traffic within the nodes.
